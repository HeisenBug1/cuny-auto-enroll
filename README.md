# What this script does

This python script will automatically enroll you to any class saved in your shopping cart in CUNYFirst.
It uses image recognition to identify and click in your browser. And it will check if a class opens up every 5 min and if any class opens up, it will automatically enroll you in that class.
It stops after it enrolls at least **one** class. So, you will have to run the script again to keep checking for any other class in your shopping cart.


## Initial Setup Requirements:

You need to provide screenshots of specific areas of the CUNYFirst website in order for the script to know where it should click. Since every display has different screen resolutions, you will need to provide screenshot samples for this script to work.
